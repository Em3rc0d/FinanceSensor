# MK0 / 11 — Architecture Decision Record Index

No implementation assumption becomes permanent architecture without an ADR when the decision is consequential, difficult to reverse or changes a product invariant.

## ADR-014 evidence boundary

ADR-014 freezes only the **logical recovery ownership and hardening model**:

```text
SERVER MASTER KEY               REJECTED
PASSWORD-ONLY RECOVERY          REJECTED FOR MK0
ASYMMETRIC RECOVERY KEY         ACCEPTED AT SPIKE LEVEL
RECOVERY PRIVATE KEY            USER-HELD / OFFLINE
PER-EPOCH RECOVERY COVERAGE     REQUIRED
POST-RECOVERY DEVICE HARDENING  REQUIRED
TENANT + RECOVERY ROTATION      REQUIRED
```

Evidence:

- `ADR-014-RECOVERY-WITHOUT-SERVER-MASTER-KEY.md`
- `../10-evidence/EV-Q005-RECOVERY-ELECTROSHOCK-2026-09-01.md`
- `../../spikes/e2ee-sync/test/recovery.test.js`

It does not freeze the production HPKE/AEAD/signature implementation, platform key-store behavior, Recovery Kit UX or physical disaster recovery.

## Decision discipline

An ADR is required when a choice affects one or more of:

- security boundary;
- financial correctness;
- tenant isolation;
- persistent schema;
- sync protocol;
- external API lock-in;
- device compatibility;
- recovery/deletion guarantees;
- signature interaction contract.

Minor implementation detail does not need an ADR.

## Rule

If code and ADR disagree, either the code is wrong or the ADR must be explicitly superseded. Silent architectural drift is not accepted.

`SPIKE-ACCEPTED` is intentionally weaker than release-grade `PROVEN`.
